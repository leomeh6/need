<h1>About Little Talented 11 Year Old hacker</h1>
<p>Leo was a unpopular kid at school and thought he was soo good at technology just because everyone in his family weren't as good. he kept on lieing because he never felt so popular. but one day. the first day the corona virus made us have to stay home... there was an error with jamf... and all of a sudden... a. Terminal. Window. Popped. Up. He was shocked. He didn't know what to do! So he messed around with commands. blah blah blah he started to get the hang of a secret error that jamf has im not supposed to tell. He found a tool online called "Routersploit". He sucked. now he's absolute pro. but there is another tool that even more hackers use. Metaploit. A very powerful tool for the good side and bad side. With over 4000+ exploits... He can do almost anything. welp. he got bored. he started to look at the contents of routersploit. he started to understand some of the code. now he is making tools(not powerful ones tho).aannnd just like last time. he got bored. now presently... He's learning html. and coded me. a website. any way why did i tell you my hacking life story. all you wanted was information of this site. nah to precious to delete.</p>
